      " the overseer of a tin mine in Malaysia; and then further and further on, all around the world – Fiji, Bolivia, the Guinea Coast, Ceylon – working in\n",
      " mines or warehouses or plantations or whatever came his way; how finally he had surfaced in Calcutta, making his living by working as an agent in\n",

      " friendship of a number of leading nationalists.\"), Sentence(\"This had, of course, estranged him and his wife from most circles of British society in the city and led\n",
      " to innumerable colourful slights and insults at clubs and tea parties, but that had made very little difference to Lionel Tresawsen, since those people\n",
      " had never been particularly pleasant to him anyway.\"), Sentence(\"He had also begun to attend seances conducted by a Russian medium, a large lady who had\n",

      " whether you’d like him.\"), Sentence(\"Of course I’d like him, I cried.\"), Sentence(\"I like him already.\"), Sentence(\"You don’t know him, she said.\"), Sentence(\"He’s not at all like us, you know.\"), Sentence(\"What do you mean ‘us’?\"), Sentence(\"I said.\"), Sentence(\"Not much like me, she said.\"), Sentence(\"Nor like our parents, or Tridib, or you, or anyone …\n",

      " that most of his breadth lay in the thickness of his overcoat and that his head reached no higher up Robi’s shoulder than did mine.\"), Sentence(\"When he turned to Ila, and stuck out his hand, I wondered whether he looked older than he ought because his face had been burnt and coarsened\n",
      " by the desert sun.\"), Sentence(\"But it wasn’t that: it was because of a premature, slightly suspicious gravity that made him wrinkle up his eyes appraisingly when\n",
