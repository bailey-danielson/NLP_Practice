       "              'But since I\\n always heard my grandmother using that word as a proper noun, I grew up believing that ‘Gastric’ was the name of an organ peculiar to Tridib – a\\n kind of aching tooth that grew out of his belly button.',\n",
       "              'Of course, I never dared ask to see it.',\n",

       "              'She believed him to be capable of exerting his influence at a\\n distance, like a baneful planet – and since she also believed the male, as a species, to be naturally frail and wayward, she would not allow herself to\\n take the risk of having him for long in our flat where I, or my father, might be tempted to move into his orbit.',\n",

       "              'This was one of her complaints\\n against him: not that he didn’t get along with his father, for she didn’t much care for his father either – but that he had allowed something like that to\\n interfere with his prospects and career.',\n",
       "              'For her, likes and dislikes were unimportant compared to the business of fending for oneself in the world:\\n as far as she was concerned it was not so much odd as irresponsible of Tridib to shut himself away in that old house with his grandmother; it\\n showed him up as an essentially lightweight and frivolous character.',\n",
       "              'She might have changed her opinion if he had been willing to marry and settle\\n down (and she hadn’t any doubt at all that she could have found him a rich wife), but every time she suggested it he merely laughed.',\n",
       "              'This was further\\n proof that he lacked that core of gravity and determination which distinguishes all responsible and grown-up men; a sure sign that he was\\n determined to waste his life in idle self-indulgence.',\n",
       "              'And yet, although she would pretend to dismiss him with a toss of her head, she never ceased\\n to be wary of him, to warn me against his influence: at heart she believed that all men would be like him if it were not for their mothers and wives.',\n",

       "              'Being a\\n schoolteacher herself, she had an inordinate respect for academic work of any kind: she saw research as a life-long pilgrimage which ended with a\\n named professorship and a marble bust in the corridors of Calcutta University or the National Library.',\n",
